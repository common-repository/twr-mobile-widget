== Description ==

Sign-up Widget for WhatsApp Broadcasting Lists

The plugin is helping WhatsApp Broadcasting Lists owners (for WhatsApp Newsletters) to automate the sign-up process with a widget that can be positioned in any sidebar as a sign-up form.

Basically, it offers to any company, product, or service Wordpress based website an easy to use form with two steps for the visitors to save the WhatsApp Broadcaster number, accept the terms and conditions, and send a message as an opt-in action.

And it’s GDPR compliant.

To set it up you need to complete the following fields, as you can see in the attached screenshot.

* Widget title – available on top of the plugin on all steps
* Terms URL – GDPR compliant
* Phone Number – the broadcaster phone number
* Phone Name – for branding purposes
* Start Message – the message that a user is sending in the last step to the broadcaster phone number, in order to become a subscriber
